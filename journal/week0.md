# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

This week encompassed multiple topics including architecture, cloud services, the Well-Architected Framework, budgets and billing, utilizing the CLI/scripting, and IAM. I ran into a few issues with this week's required assignments; however, the homework challenge went smoothly.
For the challenge I added MFA and created an IAM user. I also created the conceptual and logical diagram - these were both recreations to become acquiainted with Lucid Charts and do not significantly differ from the provided examples. Please see links:

**Conceptual**:

**Logical**

**MFA**

Regarding issues that I encountered: 

1) I initially couldn't see Budget in my IAM user to confirm the CLI budget. I had to enable IAM billing in the root account and then attach a billing policy to the IAM user. Following the root user adjustments, budgets populated in the IAM.  
2) When following along in the CLI video - I kept running into an error with the budget json -- I cleared and ran, cleared and ran and checked formulas to no avail. I took a break, and then returned to check formulas once again and behold! I was missing a "/" on the path for notifications-with-subscribers.

3) Within the pricing video instructions, I found that my AWS account currently did not list "Billing" as a metric. I ended up going directly to the billing section under alerts. Once clicked, the subsequent screen was similar to the example provided by Chirag (i.e. displaying a similar "Specify metric and conditions" and Namespace "AWS/Billing"). I was also able to specify the dollar amount threshold of $10 and create the noted alerts that shows in "All Alerts".

4) Finally - not as much of an issue, but a curiousity. I didn't have VSC so I ended up downloading the toold so I could edit and save the svg. I also wanted to to see if the xml was indeed the trigger to get the Momento image to work in Lucid charts. I ended up editing the code purely adding the xml (w/ no other adjustments) and was unable to generate the image (still received the checkerboard). I then proceeded to edit the code and save according to the suggestions (1 at a time) to find that the culprit was Fill="currentColor". In my momento.svg version I retained all the original code with the exception of fill-current color and the image populated successfully. It did appear a bit pixelated - not sure if removing the other code (width/height) would correct, but that will be an item to investiagte at a later time when I am more familiar.

Overall - a successful week. Eager for Week 1!
